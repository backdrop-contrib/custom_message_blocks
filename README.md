# custom_message_blocks
Provides a new type of block, called "Message". These are be styled to look like the default status/info/warning/error messages.

This is a placeholder repo; just claming the namespace for now. It is meant to hold a module that provides what was requested as a feature against Backdrop core here: https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/3408
