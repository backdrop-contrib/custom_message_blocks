# Custom Message Blocks
Provides a new type of block, called "Message". These are be styled to look like the default status/info/warning/error messages.

This is a placeholder repo; just claming the namespace for now. It is meant to hold a module that provides what was requested as a feature against Backdrop core here: https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/3408

> Now that we have [#3155](https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/3155), I think that it would be a great feature to allow the creation of a new block type called "Custom message". These blocks would allow for some text to be added, and the user would have a drop-down menu available to select from `info`, `success`, `warning`, and `error`. Such blocks would then be rendered and styled to look like the system messages generated by [`backdrop_set_message()`](https://api.backdropcms.org/api/backdrop/1/search/backdrop_set_message).
>
> This would effectively allow site builders to add custom messages to various pages (layouts really), and would allow them to take advantage of the visibility conditions we have in place, to show these messages for example only to specific users/roles, or only in specific paths etc.
>
> Another use case would be to allow site builders/admins to show messages such as scheduled downtime and/or announcements, using contrib modules such as https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/block_scheduler.
